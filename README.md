# Multi-Class-and-Multi-Label

#### Multi-class and Multi-Label Classification Using Support Vector Machines using Auran Calls Dataset

- trained a SVM on each of the 3 class labels using Gaussian kernels and one-versus-all classifier
 
  - determined weight of SVM penalty and width of Gaussian kernel using 10 fold CV
 
- Trained a L1 penalized SVM with same method as above

- Used SMOTE to remedy class imbalance

#### K-Means Clustering on a Multi-Class and Multi-Label Data Set via Monte-Carlo Simulation
- Performed classification task on K-means model by using the majority class in each cluster
